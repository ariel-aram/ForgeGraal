/**
 * Obtains a [quickjs-ng](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs) engine binary for a target.
 *
 * This exists because the Node.js path has a hard ceiling on old hardware, and quickjs-ng does
 * not share it. Node's own platform support decides which *language* a machine can run: Windows 7
 * is stuck on Node 12, and 32-bit Linux on an unofficial Node 12.16.3, both far below what
 * current discord.js is written in. quickjs-ng is a small C99 engine with no such coupling — the
 * project publishes a 32-bit Windows build and a 32-bit Linux build of a *current* JavaScript
 * engine, which is the thing Node cannot offer those platforms at all.
 *
 * Measured against the official v0.16.2 binaries rather than assumed:
 *
 * - Every piece of syntax that fails to parse on the Windows 7 Node pin runs here: optional
 *   chaining, nullish coalescing and its assignment form, private class methods calling `super`,
 *   class static blocks, async generators, `Array.prototype.at`/`findLast`, `Object.hasOwn`,
 *   `String.prototype.replaceAll`/`toWellFormed`, `Promise.any`, `AggregateError`, BigInt.
 * - The 32-bit Linux build is static-pie linked, so it carries no glibc version requirement.
 * - The 32-bit Windows build declares PE subsystem 4.0, but its imports are what actually decide
 *   where it runs: `InitOnceExecuteOnce`, `InitializeConditionVariable`, `WakeConditionVariable`
 *   and `SleepConditionVariableCS`. All four are Windows Vista and later, and all four come from
 *   one block in the engine's `cutils.h` guarded by `JS_HAVE_THREADS`. So Vista and 7 are
 *   expected to work unmodified, and Windows XP needs that single block replaced (or compiled
 *   out) rather than a port.
 *
 * What this does NOT yet provide is a runtime: quickjs-ng is an engine, and a ForgeScript bot
 * needs Node's library surface on top of it. Scanning the real dependency tree, that is 30
 * builtin modules, led by `assert`, `util`, `stream`, `buffer`, `fs`, `process`, `events` and
 * `crypto`, plus sockets and TLS for Discord. Until that layer exists, this module is how the
 * engine is fetched and verified, not a way to run a bot.
