 * User-managed registry of community Node.js runtimes for targets with no official build
 * (Windows 7 / Vista, 32-bit Linux, FreeBSD, iSH). ForgeGraal does not ship any entries of
 * its own: it has no way to verify a third-party binary's authenticity ahead of time, so
 * trust is established once, explicitly, by whoever registers an entry — every entry is
 * pinned to an exact SHA-256 and re-verified on every download.
 *
 * Two manifests are consulted: `<project>/.forgegraal/runtimes.json` (project-local, checked
 * into the bot's repo so a team shares the same pinned runtime) and `<cache>/runtimes.json`
 * (global, `--global` on the CLI). Project entries are tried first.
